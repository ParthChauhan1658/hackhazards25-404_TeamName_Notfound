# 🚀 Project Title

> Smart Surveillance: Gender Classification and Aggression Detection Using AI.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
 
**Problem Statement 1 – Weave AI magic with Groq**

---

## 🎯 Objective

🎯 Problem Statement & Use Case
This project addresses the growing need for automated surveillance systems capable of detecting gender-based threats and violent behavior in real-time. In public places like parks, campuses, transportation hubs, and office buildings, it is often difficult for security personnel to monitor all areas at once, especially in high-traffic zones.

👥 Who It Serves
This system is designed for:
- Security agencies
- Smart city planners
- Campus safety departments
- Organizations focused on women’s safety
- Developers or researchers in AI for social impact

🌍 Real-World Use Case
By combining gender detection, proximity analysis, and violence recognition, this tool helps identify:
- Situations where a woman is surrounded by multiple men (potential harassment risk)
- Instances of physical violence or aggression
- Events that should trigger real-time alerts and be summarized for security reports

✅ Value It Provides
Enhances public safety through AI-powered monitoring
- Sends timely alerts via SMS for fast response
- Provides natural-language incident summaries using Groq's LLM
- Supports both offline video analysis and real-time insights
- Reduces manual workload for security teams and improves situational awareness

- Krishnendu Nair  

### Your Approach:  
- Why We Chose This Problem
  With the rise in safety concerns across public and semi-public spaces, especially involving gender-based harassment and violent behavior, we saw an urgent need for a proactive, AI-      powered surveillance solution. Traditional systems rely heavily on manual monitoring, which is both labor-intensive and prone to human error. Our goal was to augment security systems    with real-time detection and alerting to help protect vulnerable individuals—especially women—in crowded or isolated environments.
