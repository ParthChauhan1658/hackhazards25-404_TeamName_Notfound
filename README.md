# 🚀 Project Title

> Smart Surveillance: Gender Classification and Aggression Detection Using AI.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
 
**Problem Statement 1 – Weave AI magic with Groq**

---

## 🎯 Objective

🎯 Problem Statement & Use Case
This project addresses the growing need for automated surveillance systems capable of detecting gender-based threats and violent behavior in real-time. In public places like parks, campuses, transportation hubs, and office buildings, it is often difficult for security personnel to monitor all areas at once, especially in high-traffic zones.

👥 Who It Serves
This system is designed for:
- Security agencies
- Smart city planners
- Campus safety departments
- Organizations focused on women’s safety
- Developers or researchers in AI for social impact

🌍 Real-World Use Case
By combining gender detection, proximity analysis, and violence recognition, this tool helps identify:
- Situations where a woman is surrounded by multiple men (potential harassment risk)
- Instances of physical violence or aggression
- Events that should trigger real-time alerts and be summarized for security reports

✅ Value It Provides
Enhances public safety through AI-powered monitoring
- Sends timely alerts via SMS for fast response
- Provides natural-language incident summaries using Groq's LLM
- Supports both offline video analysis and real-time insights
- Reduces manual workload for security teams and improves situational awareness

### Your Approach:  
- Why We Chose This Problem- 
  With the rise in safety concerns across public and semi-public spaces, especially involving gender-based harassment and violent behavior, we saw an urgent need for a proactive, AI-      powered surveillance solution. Traditional systems rely heavily on manual monitoring, which is both labor-intensive and prone to human error. Our goal was to augment security systems    with real-time detection and alerting to help protect vulnerable individuals—especially women—in crowded or isolated environments. 
- Key challenges-
  - Real-time gender detection: Classifying individuals as male or female using visual data under variable lighting, angles, and movement.
  - Surrounding detection logic: Designing a spatial logic to detect when a woman is being encircled or outnumbered by men.
  - Violence recognition: Incorporating a pre-trained model to recognize patterns of aggressive or violent behavior in video frames.
  - Timely alerting: Ensuring alerts are triggered at the right time without false positives and sending SMS notifications via Twilio.
  - Natural-language summaries: Generating clear, human-readable incident reports using LLMs (Groq in this case).
  
- Pivots, brainstorms, or breakthroughs during hacking
  - Originally, the idea was just gender classification, but during brainstorming we realized that identifying potential threats based on social dynamics (like a lone woman being       surrounded) could add much more value.
  - A major breakthrough came with the integration of a violence detection model, which allowed us to move beyond passive monitoring to actual risk detection.
  - We debated using OpenAI/GPT, but discovered Groq’s LLM was faster for summarizing frame-level insights, which made it perfect for real-time or near-real-time use cases.
  - Lastly, combining everything into a streamlit UI helped make the tool accessible for non-technical users—something we felt was essential for deployment in actual safety centers.
